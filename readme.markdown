[Blog post on company website](http://www.ekouk.com/blog/facebook-landing-page/)

#### Main motivations:

- let's do something to stand out of the crowd
- ulitilize FB potential


#### What I've learnt:

- Facebook SDK
- jQuery Ajax calls debugging
- console.log breaking IE
- clickjacking
- a few JS libraries (modernizr)
- CSS3 scaling
- much much about browser compatibility

#### Still to do:

- code is somehow messy, this time I would make it better
- no https (need to find affordable hosting with SSL)
